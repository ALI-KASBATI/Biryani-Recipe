      <ol>
      <li>Wash the rice in cold water until the water runs clear, then soak the rice in cold water for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>In a large pot or dutch oven, heat the ghee or oil over medium-high heat. Add the cumin and coriander seeds and fry for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add the sliced onions and fry for 5-7 minutes, until they turn golden brown. Add the ginger-garlic paste and fry for another minute.</li>
      <li>Add the chicken pieces and fry for 5-7 minutes, until they are browned on all sides.</li>
      <li>Add the garam masala, turmeric powder, chili powder, and salt to taste. Stir well to coat the chicken and onions with the spices.</li>
      <li>Add the yogurt, chopped cilantro, and chopped mint leaves. Stir well to combine.</li>
      <li>Drain the soaked rice and add it to the pot. Stir well to combine with the chicken and yogurt mixture.</li>
      <li>Add 4 cups of water and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let the biryani simmer for 20-25 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the chicken is tender.</li>
      <li>Once the biryani is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it rest for 5-10 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve hot, garnished with additional cilantro and mint leaves if desired.</li>
